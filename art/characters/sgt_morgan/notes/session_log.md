# Session log

Newest first. One entry per working session, a few lines each: what was done, what is
next, anything a fresh session must know.

## 2026-10-07 00:10 UTC — stopped at Jeff's request (API window nearly full)

Rule added after reading the drafts: **reality wins** over the AI-generated image where they
conflict (see CLAUDE.md, Source of truth). The critique pass must revise specs 01 to 05 and 09
against it; the writer prompts in `scripts/workflows/spec_writers.js` already carry it.

State: specs 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 09 written (drafts, uncritiqued); all six research notes
done; everything pushed to hexcom master. Remaining specs to write: 06 head and face,
07 hair, 08 rig and pose, 10 shirt and gaiter, 11 gloves, 12 hard armour, 13 plate
carrier, 14 belt and leg rigs, 15 carbine, 16 materials library, 17 evaluation scene,
18 pipeline. Their prompts are in `scripts/workflows/spec_writers.js` (Workflow tool
script; run two agents at a time). After that: critique and revise pass, then
`spec/00_overview.md`, then the fast-loop tooling.

## 2026-10-06 — cloud session 1 (Fable)

Done: environment scouted; reference crops; five analyst notes plus a consolidated
reference analysis; research notes for dimensions (ANSUR II filtered to the soldier's
build) and generators (MPFB2 works headless, Rigify included); specs 01 (foot, ankle,
sock) and 09 (combat trousers) drafted; assets downloaded (textures, HDRIs, CC0 models,
MakeHuman packs, AI helpers) with a restore manifest; Workbench confirmed as the fast
headless form renderer (about 5 s). Spec document for Jeff:
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/e7f849ec-d7e4-4cfd-8fde-a85a6dc9c76e

In progress: a two-at-a-time workflow writing the remaining research notes (assets,
generators finish, Blender capabilities, AI helpers, prototypes) and the sixteen
remaining specs. The account's 5-hour API window is the limiting resource: keep at most
two agents running at once.

Next: critique and revise all specs (fidelity, feasibility, cross-spec interfaces),
then write spec/00_overview.md and start the fast-loop tooling (Blender server, metrics,
contact sheets). Render-heavy work waits for Jeff's GPU machine.
